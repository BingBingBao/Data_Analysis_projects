# Global Renewable Energy Usage (2020-2024)

This dataset is loaded from Kaggel https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hajraamir21/global-renewable-energy-usage-2020-2024


This dataset contains information on renewable energy adoption and usage by households around the world, spanning the years 2020 to 2024. It provides insights into the growing trend of renewable energy sources like solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal being utilized in residential settings. The data includes factors such as household size, income levels, urban vs rural locations, and government subsidies, which may influence renewable energy adoption and consumption.

# Some Interesting Questions to Explore:
1. What is the distribution of the renewable energy?
2. How does this distribution differ across continents or countries?
   Are certain energy sources more dominant in specific regions?
3. What is the adoption trend?
4. Do factors such as household size, location, or subsidy status influence renewable energy adoption?
5. Higher Monthly usage of renewable energy, higher cost savings?
6. Does receiving a subsidy impact monthly energy usage?

# Data Analysis Results:
## 1. What is the distribution of the renewable energy?

Insights: 
1. Wind energy dominates slightly but is closely followed by Solar, Hydro, and Biomass. 
2. Geothermal energy has the smallest share, possibly due to geographical or infrastructure constraints. 
Then, we now explore the specific distribution for each continent.

## 2. How does the distribution differ across continents or countries?

Insights:
1. There are some slight differences in the distribution across continents;
2. Wind is the leading energy source in Africa, Asia, and South America; 
3. Solar dominates in North America;
4. Hydro has the largest share in Europe.

## 3. Adoption Trends over time

Insights: 
1. Wind dominates in Africa, Asia, and South Americaï¼Œ while Solar leads in North America.
2. Australia shows the most balanced growth across all energy sources.
3. Europe demonstrates a clear distinction in the adoption of various energy sources.

## 4. Relationship Between Energy Adoption and Household size/Location/Subsidy

Insights: 

Based on the Boxplot Or Chi-square Test (P=0.41/0.94/0.63), the choice of energy source does not appear to be influenced by household size/location/subsidy in a statistically significant way.

## 5. Higher Usage, Higher cost saving?
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ef50009-6766-43ea-b9b3-615b43f0845d)

Insights: 
1. No **strong or consistent** positive association between Monthly usage and Cost saving;
2. Larger households save more? did not see from the date;
3. Larger households use more? could not see it either.
So, The relationships between Monthly Usage, Cost Saving, and Household Size appear weak or non-existent based on this data

## 6. Subsidy vs. Monthly Usage

Insights: Monthly usage distributions are similar between households with and without subsidies for all energy sources.
